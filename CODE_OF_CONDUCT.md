# Code of Conduct

> harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of religion.

A code of conduct is a charge to better behavior through a set of rules to abide by. My beliefs are built on a code of conduct so I am going to use instead.

## The 10 Commandments;

- You shall have no other gods before Me.
- You shall make no idols.
- You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
- Keep the Sabbath day holy.
- Honor your father and your mother.
- You shall not murder.
- You shall not commit adultery.
- You shall not steal.
- You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
- You shall not covet.
